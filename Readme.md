This is the open-sourced code for the paper [A Unitary Transform Based Generalized Approximate Message Passing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08861) on GUAMP algorithm, which deals with inference on genealized linear models (GLM).  


Here are some suggestions about how to run the GUAMP code.

1.Download the programm and unzip the package 

2.Place the folder named demoGUAMP into Philip's [GAMP program](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gampmatlab/) in path .../latest/trunk/code.

3.Open the folder and run the code named "demoCompare.m".Please make sure the folders listed below all exist.
